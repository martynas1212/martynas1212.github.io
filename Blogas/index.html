                        </div>
                        Galakrond Rogue was the strongest deck of, and I feel that after all of the card releases and meta shake-ups, it’s still the best deck we have (although the stake got closer than it was before). Popularity of Hunter is somewhat keeping it in check, but even its worst Hunter matchups are like 45/55, meaning that they’re completely beatable. Galakrond Rogue didn’t really get anything special in Galakrond’s Awakening. A few cards were tested (such as Skyvateer or Escaped Manasaber), but ultimately they were cut. Some builds still run Boompistol Bully, but it’s more of a tech choice. The deck is good for the same reasons it was good before – high tempo swing turns. Whether it’s a big Lackey turn, playing Galakrond, the Nightmare and then your free cards, Heistbaron Togwaggle‘s treasure turn, powerful Flik Skyshiv turn or just a simple huge Edwin VanCleef turn, the deck has A LOT of ways to put pressure on the opponent. And it just happens that many of decks in the current meta have no great way to answer those.

                           <i>EMBIGGEN DRUID</i>
                        </div>
                        Embiggen Druid became a sudden hit shortly after Galakrond’s Awakening’s release. Over just a few days, it turned from a completely off-meta build to something everyone was playing. At one point it reached nearly 30% of popularity on the ladder. And all of that because of a single card – Winged Guardian. Or was it? Old Guardian explores the topic in this article, so be sure to check it out. But overall, its popularity has been steadily falling lately, and it’s already at only just a few % in Legend. Players have found optimal ways to play against it, but it’s still a solid build. Its power mostly comes from “cheating out” big minions. The three key cards are Embiggen, Strength in Numbers and Breath of Dreams. The first makes your entire deck more expensive, but also stronger. +2/+2 on a minion is usually well worth 1 extra mana, especially when the minion comes with extra effects such as Elusive, Divine Shield or Rush. Strenght in Numbers is quite easy to finish with all the high cost minions, and summoning one of them for just 1 mana is amazing, even if delayed (especially since it has synergy with Embiggen itself – the minions you pull retain the buff). And finally, Breath of Dreams lets you play your big minions faster and completely negates the downside of Embiggen while not even costing you a card. Once you add a few generic, strong minions, those three cards can carry your entire deck. That’s also why it’s often considered to be a “high roll” deck – if you get all three, then it’s nearly impossible to lose the game. If you don’t get any of them – your entire deck will be very weak.

                        </div>
                        Mech Paladin first became popular after Rise of the Mech event in Rise of Shadows expansion, when a bunch of cards were buffed and SN1P-SN4P was added to the game. Buff to Glowstone Technician was the main reason for the deck to become a thing – at 6 mana, the handbuff was just too slow, but at 5 mana it was already possible to survive that long before unleashing some really powerful turns. However, forget everything you knew about Mech Paladin before – most of time it used to be a slower build that didn’t really do much for the first few turns just to make a big comeback on T6. This time around, thanks to some of the new cards, it has sped up heavily and is now an Aggro deck. Sky Claw is a bad card in the slower build which was build around Kangor's Endless Army (because the 1/2 and 1/1’s would just dilute the pool of Mechs to revive from), while it’s amazing in Aggro. Similarly, Goboglide Tech works much better in an Aggro/Tempo build, because you can use it on curve much more consistently, and a 3 mana 4/4 with Rush is really good. The recently released Shotbot makes the deck’s early game even more powerful – it’s sticky and you really want your Mechs to stay on the board so you can take advantage of all the synergies. Overall I feel like it’s one of the best decks currently available, but it’s still underplayed compared to some other worse builds. I guess that lots of players still haven’t discovered its potential (or just don’t feel like playing it).

                            <i>HIGHLANDER HUNTER</i>
                        </div>
                        Highlander Hunter has went through many different iterations early in the Descent of Dragons meta. We’ve seen more or less aggressive ones, Dragon version, Beast version, Mech version or even “all in one” version. Before Galakrond’s Awakening, Secret version was a “go-to” build, and it made the most sense then. However, with the release of Rotnest Drake in Galakrond’s Awakening, the tide has shifted once again. So Dragons it is. Highlander Hunter is so good, because of its flexibility. You can play Aggro, you can play Midrange and against some decks you can even try to play a Control role. You have a great balance of strong minions, removal spells, solid weapons, as well as aggression (ways to just finish your opponent off). If you hit a good curve, you can have a powerful turn after a powerful turn all the way until the late game (where you finish things off with Brann or Alexstrasza). And, of course, having Zephrys in your deck adds even more to the flexibility I was talking, since it can be anything depending on what you need at the moment. Overall it’s one of the most balanced decks in the meta.

                        </div>
                        Galakrond Warrior is a sort of a mix between Aggro and Midrange, and it’s great at what it does. While not as fast as decks like Dragon hunter, it can still pack a punch thanks to the Invoke cards (remember that Warrior’s Invoke gives him +3 Attack for a turn). On the other hand, it has some really cool combos, can easily deal 1 AoE damage to clear some token boards, and – of course – comes with a burst combo finisher (which is honestly not necessary most of the time, but it’s good to have it). The deck got two new upgrades in Galakrond’s Awakening – both Risky Skipper and Bomb Wrangler have found their way into the strongest builds. However the deck’s ranking has dropped – mostly due to meta changes. While I do believe that it’s one of the best decks in Legend, Embiggen Druid is a bad matchup, and it’s still very popular at lower ranks, making it harder for Warrior players. But given that Embiggen Druid numbers get lower and lower, I would suspect that Galakrond Warrior will only get better in time.
